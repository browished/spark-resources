                <p>As editors with 10 years of experience to our names and our own reputations outside of Saturn, we'd gain absolutely nothing by sharing harmful files. This project was started by two best friends for fun in early 2024, and has come along way with the help of many. For our account saftey, all staff members regardless of ownership are listed under the same role. We do not profit off of this project in any way, and never will.</p>

                <p><a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/false-positive/" target="_blank">False positives</a> are not uncommon when pirating, especially when it comes to Windows Defender, Norton and McAfee. The majority of these files have been modified in order to get around licensing, and sometimes this behavior may be targeted. Any sort of AI, PUP (Potentially unwanted program), Machine Learning (!ML), Rep/Reputation and hacktool/crack detections can safely be dismissed.</p>
